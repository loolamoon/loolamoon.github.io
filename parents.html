<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>What if I have an overdue book?</h4>
<p>We don't charge late fees! However, book checkout privileges will be suspended until all overdue books are returned.</p>

<h4>I can't find my overdue book!</h4>
<p>Keep looking for it! If you want your checkout privileges back immediately, you can pay a fine (equal to the price of the book).</p>

<h4>How do I pay the fine?</h4>
<p>We take cash only. Fines should be paid to the main office (not the library!) with the fine notice. Please pay in exact amounts as we don't have enough cash on hand to make change! If you need a fine notice, contact the LMT.</p>

<h4>I paid a fine and then found the book; do I get a refund?</h4>
<p>If you paid a cash fine and then return the lost book, you are eligible for a refund if you return the book within one year of its original due date.</p>

<h4>Do fines carry over between school years?</h4>
<p>Yes, and they also carry over between district schools.</p>

<h4>I have an overdue book from a different district school; can I return it to Cooper?</h4>
<p>You can return any district school library book to any district school library and the Library Media Tech will make sure it gets where it needs to go.</p>

<h4>I accidentally damaged my book. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Bring it back to the library! We might be able to fix it. Please do not try to fix it yourself; the library has access to specialized repair materials that can get the book looking like new again. It's much cheaper than replacing it. If we can fix the book, you don't have to pay a fine.</p>

How can I contact the library?
<ul>
	<li>In person</li>
	<li>Phone: (707) 555-5555</li>
	<li><a href="contact.html">Email</a></li>
